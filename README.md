# Capstone Project - Seattle City Vehicle Collision Data Analysis 

## Section 1: Introduction/Business Problem section

Under this project with the given set of data, I decided to build a model to predict if a collision with injuries will occur or not based on the weather and road conditions and determining the most susceptible areas.

If the data shows this to be a problem in certain areas, than the measures such as changing road infrastructure, with the procurement and installation of the road signs to reflect the weather conditions, among others, could be implemented.


## Section 2: Data

The data that will be used was collected by the Seattle Police Department, recorded by Traffic Records, and provided by Coursera via a download link.

Among others in the data set, this project will make use of data on the weather and road conditions during the collision, the geographical area where the collision took place, and the reasons for collisions.

The main variables that will be used to construct the model are given below:

| Attribute    | Description                                                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| SDOT_COLCODE | A code given to the collision by Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT).|
| SDOT_COLDESC | A description of the collision corresponding to the collision code.          |
| WEATHER      | A description of the weather conditions during the time of the collision.    |
| ROADCOND     | The condition of the road during the collision.                              |
| LOCATION     | The geographical area where the collision took place.                        |
