[TOC]

This file, and other associated files, make up my contribution to the final Peer Reviewed Assignment for the Coursera Capstone Project for Applied Data Science Capstone. This was my final module in the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ibm-data-science-professional-certificate) programme.

For reference I include the original definition for each part of the assignment.

## Part 1 [Week 1]

Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always  target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a  problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and  why they would care about your problem.
